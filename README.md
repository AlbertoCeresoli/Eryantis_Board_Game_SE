### *Eriantys*  
*Hidden by the white whiteness of the clouds, there is a world where floating islands are home to great schools for the young creatures of the five magical realms. Sweet little dragons, clumsy fairies, mischievous elves, little unicorns and frogs who dream of becoming princes show up at the doors of the schools, with the hope of being admitted into the great hall and being able to admire the famous professors of their kingdom. Run one of the four great schools of Eriantys and compete with other wizards to increase your fame!*

## JARs  
In order to open jar files, you need to have a JDK for java installed on your PC.  To run the jar you have to go in the target directory and use this command:  
```java -jar AM05-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` <p> **The jar file has to be downloaded from the link in the "deliveries" folder and has to be locally put in the directory**</p>
  
**NB** The server always runs on **1234** port.
Now you're ready to play.  

### For command-line users  
In order to enable the ANSI color view from **Windows** prompt interface, you need to run as administrator the .bat file we provided before starting the game.  For a better experience as CLI users
we also recommend to choose a window-size first and not to change it for the rest of the game.
